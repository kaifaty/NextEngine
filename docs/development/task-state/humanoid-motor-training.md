## Resume in 60 seconds

- **Current conclusion:** R72 reproduces direct-source complete `cmu05` PASS in
  one coupled sparse-QP invocation, stopping at iteration ten. V8 implements
  that bounded identity and recomputes final facts from emitted integers.
- **Why:** R58–R67 reject weighted or sequential mechanisms; R69 proves simultaneous
  feasibility and R70–R72 remove the intermediate-input precondition. Exact
  R72 integer FK remains PASS: collider `0 µm`, residual `4901 µm`.
- **Next action:** Commit the V8 implementation, then run the unchanged clean
  identity once across `cmu05`, `cmu16`, `cmu139` and all 17 exact slices.
- **Current blocker:** All-clip convergence is unknown. V8 intentionally keeps
  11 `cmu139` source-active points that R57 deleted, so that clip is a stricter
  discriminator than the earlier `cmu05` research proof.
- **Do not retry:** Do not start PPO, build another broad whole-corpus
  ankle/retarget identity, zero reference velocities, add grace/settling, or
  loosen safety limits. The causal matrix rejects these as fixes.
- **Reconsider when:** One clip-global trajectory passes exact slices,
  complete-clip invariants and the same fresh all-17 safety matrix.

All TRAIN-5 checkpoints remain rejected. No optimizer run, multi-seed run,
TRAIN-5 Advance or TRAIN-6 work is authorized. Formal visual review remains
pending. This file cannot change those facts by itself.

## Decisions that still constrain the work

### D-001 — Keep TRAIN-4 optimizer-free

- **Observation:** Full-schedule R14 remains non-zero and every TRAIN-5 result
  descends from the invalidated upstream admission.
- **Evidence:** Exact R14 source audit and case-level R15-R17 reproduction.
- **Decision:** Keep TRAIN-5/6 inactive and reject optimizer-based remediation.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Resume rejected checkpoints, tune PPO/reward, or
  reinterpret improved failure counts as gate admission.
- **Consequences:** Only bounded optimizer-free reference/reset/contact work is
  allowed.
- **Uncertainty:** Whether the selected prototype is sufficient for full-corpus
  exact-zero closure remains unknown.
- **Reconsider when:** A new immutable lineage passes the full optimizer-free
  gate and its decision report explicitly advances TRAIN-4.

### D-002 — Target contact-consistent reference construction

- **Observation:** Declared contact can combine height and speed from different
  foot points, admits high support speeds, and does not ensure the final
  velocity field satisfies the same sticking constraint as the final pose.
- **Evidence:** Source audit, offline contact-trajectory correlation, failure
  clustering, and R17's large recovered/regressed response.
- **Decision:** Prototype explicit `Flight`, `HeelSticking`,
  `ForefootSticking` and `FlatSticking` modes; require one physical point to
  satisfy height and speed; solve `h(q)=0` and `J(q)v=0` together.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Another local ankle reserve/smoothing change,
  controller lead/feed-forward, zero velocities, or broad bundled remediation.
- **Consequences:** Recompute root and joint velocities after final pose/root
  correction and cross-check analytic point velocity against emitted finite
  differences.
- **Uncertainty:** Contact-consistent construction is strongly supported but
  not yet proven sufficient under PhysX.
- **Reconsider when:** A smaller intervention closes the same bounded cases
  without regressing matched controls and preserves the frozen constraints.

### D-003 — Discriminate reset semantics before full V19

- **Observation:** R27 finds eight cases above the frozen first-tick impulse
  delta and a fresh-pass/partial-hard-ROM outcome divergence at `cmu16@415`.
- **Evidence:** Complete R27 report from clean commit `3e7c54a`, exact report
  SHA-256 recorded above.
- **Decision:** Retain ADR-070 unchanged. Fresh-scene execution is acceptance
  authority; indexed running-scene reset is diagnostic-only and cannot feed an
  optimizer or admission result.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Treat buffer clearing as fresh reset, loosen the
  impulse tolerance, or add settling/grace.
- **Consequences:** Full-corpus evaluation must use fresh scenes. A future
  vector trainer must genuinely replace a slot scene before TRAIN-5.
- **Uncertainty:** The exact hidden solver/contact state responsible for each
  impulse delta is not required to reject the non-equivalent implementation.
- **Reconsider when:** A new implementation constructs a fresh scene per reset
  and independently proves its contract.

### D-004 — Close full collider geometry, not active points alone

- **Observation:** The R18 projector applies root correction, leaves joint
  correction at zero and validates only active heel/forefoot points.
- **Evidence:** Exact offline FK places the right swing-foot collider at
  `-14905`, `-11639` and `-3544 µm` for the three tick-1 `cmu139` failures;
  PhysX names that same body in every first violation.
- **Decision:** Add the existing corpus invariant `minimum collider height >=
  -2 µm` to a new bounded identity and solve conflicts with temporally coupled
  leg/root degrees of freedom.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Global root lift, impact-limit tuning or another
  root-only contact projection.
- **Consequences:** Recompute final kinematics and velocities after the solve;
  preserve hard ROM/reserve and active-point bounds exactly.
- **Uncertainty:** Whether the chosen bounded degrees of freedom avoid new
  transition/ROM regressions.
- **Reconsider when:** The four-case discriminator fails without an admissible
  correction or needs a materially different contact-mode model.

### D-005 — Close the post-smoothing contact boundary

- **Observation:** R35 fails five mixed-support windows at the last active
  frame, while a parameter-only sweep closes none of the six failures.
- **Evidence:** R35 plus the dated contact-boundary research report.
- **Decision:** V5 final contact reprojection, second collider floor and
  upward-only root-velocity closure with eight smoothing passes are retained.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Another scalar sweep or looser safety bounds.
- **Consequence:** The boundary is closed offline; later V7 refinements govern
  unsupported frames and cannot feed an optimizer.
- **Reconsider when:** A clip-global solve violates an active boundary.

### D-006 — Require one clip-global value per source frame

- **Observation:** Window-local candidate outputs disagree on overlapping
  source frames. R57 now proves exact slices and zero overlap disagreement, but
  all three complete V7 trajectories fail unchanged bounds.
- **Decision:** Retain R57's one-solve/exact-slice path and replace its solver;
  domain identity alone does not authorize a full V19 corpus identity.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Pick one overlay, normalize disagreement away or
  treat bounded reset evidence as full-corpus feasibility.
- **Reconsider when:** One deterministic clip solve passes exact overlap,
  selected-window and complete-clip checks together.

### D-007 — Authorize swing clearance only from active support

- **Observation:** V5's unsupported `5 mm` target delayed `cmu16@249` contact;
  V6's sub-micrometre correction changed `cmu16@415` by one microradian.
- **Decision:** Use `20 mm` clearance only with same-frame active support;
  unsupported frames target zero with a validated `1 µm` quantization deadband.
- **Consequence:** V7 preserves exact V1 bytes for both all-flight controls and
  R49 passes all 17 fresh scenes without changing any safety bound.
- **Reconsider when:** A clip-global trajectory provides a stronger physical
  landing model that passes the same exact evidence.

### D-008 — Use one dimensionless coupled constraint solve

- **Observation:** Sequential post-passes repeatedly repair one bound while
  breaking another; raw-variable least squares and line search are badly
  scaled and stagnate.
- **Evidence:** R58–R68 rejection sequence, R69 simultaneous feasibility and
  R72 direct-source single-invocation PASS.
- **Decision:** V8 uses one complete-clip SQP over root XYZ and ten selected
  leg joints, with dimensionless OSQP rows and no root/joint post-projection.
  Every source-inferred contact point is frozen before the solve.
- **Rejected alternatives:** More penalty tuning, per-frame IK, sequential
  velocity closure, contact-point deletion or looser safety limits.
- **Consequences:** NumPy/SciPy/OSQP are pinned private lab dependencies; final
  contact, collider, CoM, ROM and velocity facts are recomputed from emitted
  integer poses. The adapter has no runtime or corpus-admission authority.
- **Uncertainty:** Whether the unchanged solver converges on `cmu16` and the
  stricter `cmu139` mask.
- **Reconsider when:** A clean all-three-clip run fails exact bounds or requires
  per-clip tuning.

## Open hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Evidence for | Evidence against | Next discriminator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H5: one dimensionless trajectory constraint solve closes the coupled set | R69 and R72 pass complete `cmu05` simultaneously | Only one clip has passed; R72 was research-only and dirty | `CONFIRMED_CMU05`; run unchanged clean all-three evidence |
| H6: the direct immutable contact mask remains feasible | `cmu05` direct and R57 masks are identical and R72 passes | V8 retains 11 `cmu139` points deleted by R57 | Run clean `cmu139` without deletion or per-clip tuning |

Use `nextengine-training-runner` before preparing any run and
`nextengine-training-diagnostics` for causal analysis. Use
`nextengine-isaac-correspondence` when a hypothesis depends on Isaac/CPU mirror
semantics.

## Next action

1. Freeze V7/R49, R57 and dirty-worktree R72; none is corpus admission.
2. Commit V8 with pinned dependencies and integer-FK status authority.
3. Apply one clean identity to all three clips and 17 exact slices.
4. If and only if offline evidence passes, run fresh all-17 safety.
5. Keep full V19, visual/exhaustive gates and optimization blocked until then.

## Do not retry

- Rejected TRAIN-5 checkpoints or any optimizer run — upstream TRAIN-4 remains
  failed; reconsider only after a new evidence-backed TRAIN-4 Advance.
- Target lead, `D/K*qdot` feed-forward or zero reference/reset velocities —
  case-level counterfactuals churn controls, regress categories or invalidate
  full-reference initialization.
- Broad ankle/root/retarget/contact changes — repeated bundled adjustments did
  not establish first cause; reconsider only after the bounded prototype.
- Grace windows, uncounted settling or looser impact/ROM/velocity limits — they
  weaken the frozen criterion rather than fix the reference/reset state.
- Treating reduced failure counts as success — the gate requires exactly zero
  required-safety events over complete phase coverage.

## Handoff

- **Workspace state:** V8 implementation is the active uncommitted increment;
  generated reports stay under the external TRAIN-4 evaluation root.
- **Checks:** focused builder/contact tests `15/15`; R72 direct `cmu05` and its
  emitted-integer audit pass; optimizer and training remain zero.
- **Remaining risk:** clean `cmu16`/`cmu139`, exact-slice identity, fresh slice
  safety, full-corpus exact-zero coverage and visual review remain open.
- **Promotion needed:** None for reset semantics: ADR-070 is retained. Any
  future attempt to admit indexed running-scene reset requires a superseding
  ADR and new evidence.
