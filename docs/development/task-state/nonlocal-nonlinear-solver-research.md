## Resume in 60 seconds

- **Current conclusion:** NSR2-C2 passes all gates. At 512 particles the guarded
  floor stop reduces work from `26/13/153` outer/reject/HVP to `12/0/46` while
  retaining nanometric physical residual and exact oracle correspondence.
- **Current conclusion:** `outer-state-hessian-tape-v1` is bit-exact, remains
  inside its linear memory cap, improves build+HVP by `2.05x--2.43x` and total
  solve by `1.36x--1.55x` across 512--4096 particles.
- **Current action:** derive a dimensional coefficient map and nondimensional
  profiles directly from the corrected objective and primary source formulas.
- **Next gate:** NSR3-B0 must freeze water, viscosity and surface controls with
  explicit units, similarity groups and no visual/best-of-sweep tuning.
- **Do not retry:** old profile tuning, block/hybrid maps, Chebyshev radius or
  iteration sweeps, product-scale/CUDA work.
- **Runtime authority:** none.

## Decisions

### D-001 -- Separate identity

- **Observation:** FCR2 objective passes, while all admitted fast-SISSM paths
  stopped.
- **Decision:** Use `nuv-newton-krylov-r0`; preserve `nuv-variational-fcr1` as
  objective parent and historical report identity.
- **Consequence:** Solver reports and future performance roots are new; old
  timing grants no credit.

### D-002 -- Diagnose curvature before selecting a fast solver

- **Observation:** Pressure Hessian contains global `J^T J` coupling and a
  possibly indefinite geometric term not represented by FCR3-A blocks.
- **Decision:** NSR0 must prove an analytic matrix-free HVP against the verified
  gradient and a dense tiny oracle before NSR1.
- **Rejected:** implementing trust-region logic on an unverified Hessian;
  treating an approximate block as ground truth.

### D-003 -- Trust-region first, constrained reformulation conditional

- **Observation:** fixed Chebyshev becomes non-descent under changing
  pressure-bearing states.
- **Decision:** use full-HVP Steihaug--Toint trust-region Newton-CG as the first
  bounded optimizer discriminator. Consider primal-dual inequality pressure
  only if NSR1 evidence isolates penalty stiffness.
- **Rejected:** simultaneous solver/model changes, which would make a result
  uninterpretable.

### D-004 -- Reuse immutable outer-state curvature

- **Observation:** positions, active pressure centers and pair support do not
  change inside one trust-region outer state, but A1 recomputed their Hessian
  coefficients for every Krylov product.
- **Decision:** select `outer-state-hessian-tape-v1`; its construction is
  charged to total work and storage is bounded linearly in particles/pairs.
- **Evidence:** exact A1 correspondence, `2.05x--2.43x` combined build+HVP and
  `1.36x--1.55x` total speedup in two clean pinned campaigns.
- **Consequence:** use A2 for later report-only CPU research; retain A1 as the
  exact oracle. This grants no physical, GPU or runtime authority.

## Required context

1. `docs/architecture/agent-routing.md`, SPEC-38, ADR-076 and ADR-081.
2. `docs/plans/nonlocal-continuum-formula-reclosure/README.md` and
   `00-formula-contract.md`.
3. The stopped formula-reclosure task state and FCR3-B2 evidence.
4. `docs/development/nonlocal-nonlinear-solver-research-2026-08-20.md`.
5. `docs/plans/nonlocal-nonlinear-solver-research/README.md` and the current
   frozen stage contract.

## Exact next action

1. Derive SI dimensions for every objective coefficient and state variable.
2. Map publication parameters into dimensionless groups and identify any
   coefficient that cannot be reconstructed from an authoritative source.
3. Freeze separate water, viscosity and surface profiles plus tolerances before
   implementing multi-step controls.
4. Proceed to NSR3-B1 only after the profile contract is reviewable.

## Reconsideration triggers

- Pairwise Descent paper/code becomes public: compare only after its exact
  formula and identity are reviewable.
- NSR0 HVP mismatch: fix one derivation/transcription defect under the same
  contract; a second mismatch stops the branch.
- NSR1 correct-model but penalty-dominated cost: draft an independent
  constrained primal-dual formula contract.
