## Resume in 60 seconds

- **Current conclusion:** exact W0C diagnostics reject a ceiling-only repair,
  `ghost-cell-shell-v1` and `zero-velocity-settle-v1`. The settling generator
  exactly matches an independent brute-force implementation, but iteration
  demand grows `2 → 33 → 40 → 47`, penetration grows
  `171 → 340 → 521 → 710 µm`, and its last diagnostic state fails the first
  production-ceiling step. No successor roots, runtime or public schema are
  authorized.
- **Selected consumer:** one sealed `4 × 2 × 1 m` basin, `0.75 m` depth,
  nominal `48k`/hard `50k` samples, one `0.5 m`/`50 kg` PhysX crate and debug
  particles; unavailable capability selects an authored dry variant before
  activation.
- **Authority:** private `f64` solve, ties-to-even canonical sample
  position/velocity after every 240 Hz substep, and the next substep starts
  from that state. CPU is canonical; GPU is optional mirror only.
- **Next action:** apply persistent-problem escalation and specify the smallest
  non-particle boundary discriminator, beginning with an analytical volume-map
  candidate. Preserve fixed-point position/velocity authority and the
  unchanged 20-iteration hydro gate.
- **Activation gate:** the main R8 row remains `PLANNED / NOT_ACTIVE` until
  `CONTINUUM-WATER-REF-P1 = PASS`.
- **Current uncertainty:** particle-shell boundary formulations may be the
  wrong adjacent layer for the selected no-warm-start/fixed-point authority.
  It is unknown whether an analytical volume or density map can preserve
  partition, clearance and exact independent reconstruction without hidden
  state. Full-corpus correctness and 50k real-time cost remain unmeasured;
  every `CONTINUUM-*` ProductCheck is `NOT_RUN`.
- **Do not retry:** public `ContinuumMaterialSystem` first, GPU authority,
  hidden warm-start/float continuation, iterative coupling, sleep before exact
  persistence, or wet terrain before dry-sand evidence.
- **Independent later branches:** SPEC-43 owns temperature/composition/phase;
  SPEC-44 warm-start advice starts only after W1-W6 promotion. Neither changes
  the water worktree's next action or receives water-gate credit.

## Decisions that constrain the next work

### D-001 — Solver family, not solver monoculture

- **Evidence:** the research report and SPEC-38.
- **Decision:** CPU DFSPH for water; APIC/MLS-MPM for one calibrated dry-sand
  profile; separate material-specific SoA.
- **Rejected:** one SPH solver/particle record for water, sand, mud and snow.
- **Reconsider when:** the same frozen corpora show one method strictly
  dominates without weakening state/history semantics.

### D-002 — CPU canonical fixed-point boundary

- **Observation:** an internal `f64` trajectory with hidden pressure/warm-start
  state is not an exact replay contract.
- **Decision:** after each water substep publish only stable sample ID,
  micrometre position and micrometre-per-second velocity; uniform mass is in
  the profile, other solve fields are rebuilt, and warm start is disabled.
- **Closure:** W0B fixes the Rust/LLVM targets and flags, float-environment
  probes, exact DFSPH operations/order, integer neighbor membership,
  convergence branches, corpus roots, capacities and typed failures. RC1 keeps
  those original roots as rejected-profile evidence; W0C must issue successor
  roots before promotion.
- **Rejected:** float owner state, final-output-only quantization and GPU-first
  canonical execution.
- **Reconsider when:** a later consumer and exact cross-target evidence require
  a versioned larger continuation state.

### D-003 — One-pass composite coupling

- **Decision:** freeze rigid input, solve water, emit one canonical reaction
  batch, let PhysX integrate once, then publish both owners or neither.
- **Rejected:** delayed reaction, wall-time-selected iteration count, duplicate
  contact writers and partial water/rigid commits.
- **Reconsider when:** the W3 corpus fails a frozen stability threshold and a
  bounded fixed-iteration alternative passes without changing authority.

### D-004 — Sealed pinned-active exact persistence first

- **Decision:** one region, no halo/transfer, exact active state in a composite
  checkpoint; sleep/wake is a later lossy conversion with separate roots and
  repeated-cycle evidence.
- **Rejected:** sidecar save, active-root equals sleep-root claim, camera-driven
  eviction and reconstructing dirty state from immutable content.
- **Reconsider when:** W5 passes and a real streaming consumer requires 20X or
  21X.

### D-005 — Product and budget gate

- **Decision:** 50k is the production particle gate; 100k is stress/report.
  Promotion must stay inside current THOTH physical `4/6 ms` p95/p99 and
  integrated `8/12 ms` ceilings.
- **Stop rule:** after two evidence-backed W2 optimization cycles, a miss keeps
  the track `RESEARCH_ONLY`. A smaller gate, larger budget or GPU authority is
  a new decision.

### D-006 — Terrain material ladder

- **Decision:** exact calibrated dry sand → serial reference → exclusive
  prescribed-wheel contact → exact active persistence → saturation/drainage →
  optional closed free-water flux.
- **Rejected:** generic soil claim, simultaneous PhysX/MPM ground contact,
  full vehicle first and wet material before dry persistence.
- **Current blocker:** Package 10T has no calibrated exact constants/curve
  thresholds; terrain code must not start until it closes them.

## Open hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Evidence for | Evidence against | Next discriminator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1: fixed-point-boundary CPU DFSPH passes the clean-water corpus | Exact free-fall/repeat roots pass; ghost shell restores the initial partition; settling is independently reproducible | Original W0B, ghost-shell dynamics and zero-velocity settling fail; larger ceilings only defer failure | Analytical non-particle volume-map boundary under exact local partition and unchanged-ceiling soak |
| H2: 50k CPU water fits the current THOTH budget | bounded sealed region and fixed profile | published prior art does not prove Next Engine 240 Hz cost | W2 exact 10k/50k/100k workload after W1 PASS |
| H3: one-pass coupling is stable for the basin crate | narrow consumer and fixed cadence | fast impact/added-mass behavior is unmeasured | W3 float/impact corpus and reaction closure |
| H4: one Drucker-Prager profile covers the first wheel scenario | established dry-sand model | exact source material and curve thresholds are not selected | Package 10T calibration closure |

## Required context

1. [Agent routing](../../architecture/agent-routing.md), SPEC-26 and current
   physics ADRs.
2. [Main roadmap](../../roadmap.md), R8, B-10 and performance boundaries.
3. [SPEC-38](../../architecture/38-continuum-material-physics.md) and ADR-076.
4. [Water roadmap](../../plans/continuum-water/README.md), especially W0B/W1.
5. [W0C calibration reclosure](../../plans/continuum-water/00c-hydro-calibration-reclosure.md).
6. [Research report](../continuum-material-physics-research-2026-08-16.md).

## Next action

1. Freeze one analytical volume-map boundary candidate from current primary
   method semantics: exact fields, sampling domain, quadrature, capacities and
   no hidden mutable continuation.
2. Implement production and independent local reconstruction, then require
   exact partition/convergence traces and the unchanged free-fall root.
3. Run the unchanged 20-iteration 24-step hydro soak. Reject on
   non-convergence, clearance/penetration or canonical-root mismatch.
4. If this adjacent-layer candidate also fails, stop W0C as `RESEARCH_ONLY`
   pending a new explicit authority/profile decision. Do not start W2, WG or
   PhysX coupling.

## Do not retry

- Add continuum types to `crates/contracts` during W1.
- Use SPlisHSPlasH source as a linked/copied engine implementation.
- Parallelize or add GPU before the serial correctness gate.
- Persist density, pressure, neighbor, warm-start or render cache as V1 water
  authority.
- Hide a non-convergent frame by retaining the previous water state and
  continuing the evidence run.
- Increase the 20-iteration ceiling, loosen the density tolerance or alter the
  boundary/lattice under the existing W0B roots.
- Retry `ghost-cell-shell-v1`, a uniform boundary multiplier, or another
  ceiling-only variant; the bounded W0C cycle has already rejected them.
- Retry `zero-velocity-settle-v1` or a position-only damping coefficient; its
  exact transcript shows growing solver demand and wall penetration.
- Start terrain code while Package 10T remains profile-unclosed.

## Handoff

- **Workspace claim:** tool-only W1 serial oracle plus bounded clean-tree RC1
  and W0C diagnostics. Boundary and initialization candidates are explicitly
  `NOT_SELECTED`; no runtime/public schema or ProductCheck PASS exists.
- **Checks:** current localized change passes format, strict all-target Clippy
  for water/xtask, 39/39 water tests, 99/99 + 44/44 xtask tests and all six
  `boundary-scan` checks. Clean exact-profile W0C reports are independently
  `EXACT_MATCH`; all `CONTINUUM-*` ProductChecks remain `NOT_RUN`. Broad
  `host-check` was not rerun for this diagnostic change.
- **Remaining risk:** non-particle boundary semantics, successor hydro
  calibration, external/full-corpus accuracy, 50k performance, coupling
  stability, exact persistence implementation and all terrain constitutive
  evidence remain unmeasured.
