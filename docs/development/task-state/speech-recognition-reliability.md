# Speech recognition reliability — current task state

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | `ACTIVE` |
| Updated | `2026-08-22` |
| Task key | `speech-recognition-reliability` |
| Scope | Public-data, utterance-level Russian ASR reliability in `tools/speech-timeline` |
| Definition of done | R0–R3 satisfy the gates and boundaries in `DEV-SPEECH-RELIABILITY-001`, or the first failed gate leaves the candidate explicitly report-only |
| Authority | Working context only; Accepted SPEC/ADR, `AGENTS.md` and the development specification outrank this file |

## Resume in 60 seconds

- **Current conclusion:** R2 data plumbing is real end-to-end: prepared index, deterministic degradations and degraded-audio replay through the bound GigaAM identity all run on actual public data with typed outcomes.
- **Why:** `augment` generated 2 995 derivations for 500 train/calibration clips (control + ≤5 grid conditions each), and the resident replay completed 2 995/2 995 turns — control exact 91.4 %, hardest condition noise+room 84.5 %, one typed speech_but_empty.
- **Next action:** Scale augmentation/replay to the full train/calibration partitions in background batches, then fit the constant/rule/L2-logistic baselines on the frozen outputs (§12) and report §16 metrics per condition bucket.
- **Current blocker:** None technical; wall-clock budgeting is the only scaling constraint (~90 min per 3 000 turns unpaced).
- **Do not retry:** Pooling GigaAM scores with other routes; tuning thresholds on held_out; treating the 92 %/89 % numbers as route quality benchmarks (CV domain proximity inflates them).
- **Reconsider when:** Baselines are fitted and gates need held-out evaluation runs.

## Current evidence

| Evidence | Result | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| External store `~/.cache/nextengine/speech-reliability/prepared.jsonl` | `PASS` prepare 2026-08-22 | 63 389 speech + 61 068 asset rows, splits 84 106/16 176/24 075; index sha256 `53c5eb50…` |
| `augmented/train-calib-500.jsonl` | `PASS` augment 2026-08-22 | 500 clips → 2 995 rows (controls + attenuation/MUSAN/RIRS/room+noise/EQ variants); codec-damage honestly capped out by the five-variant limit; sha256 `61b09777…`; determinism proven by fixture double-run |
| `replay-runs/gigaam-200` + `gigaam-first` | `PASS` clean replay 2026-08-22 | 200/200 held-out clips, exact 184 (92 %), WER mean 1.44 %, zero empty finals |
| `replay-runs/aug-500` | `PASS` degraded replay 2026-08-22 | 2 994 completed + 1 typed speech_but_empty; exact by condition: control 91.4 %, attenuation 91.0 %, EQ 90.2 %, MUSAN 87.1 %, room+noise 84.5 % |
| Degradation-scale replay of full partitions / baselines / calibration | `NOT_RUN` | No learned reliability claim exists yet |

## Decisions that still constrain the work

### D-001 — Reliability means pipeline transcript exactness risk

- **Observation:** ASR quality failures can arise from signal, VAD, preprocessing, scheduling or decoding; loudness and linguistic plausibility alone are not ground truth.
- **Evidence:** `DEV-SPEECH-RELIABILITY-001` sections 1–4 and 11.
- **Decision:** Name the result `recognition_reliability`; predict normalized final-transcript exactness and retain typed `no_speech`, `unheard` and technical outcomes.
- **Rejected alternatives:** A diction, accent or medical-quality score; an LLM plausibility judgement; RMS as the sole oracle.
- **Consequences:** Runtime/UI wording must describe pipeline confidence, not a property of the speaker.
- **Uncertainty:** Generic public Russian audio may not calibrate player microphones well enough for useful clear coverage.
- **Reconsider when:** Held-out results fail the declared selective-risk/coverage gates or target-domain evidence becomes admissible.

### D-002 — Corpus data and derived artifacts remain external and explicit

- **Observation:** Public speech sources have distinct authentication, attribution, redistribution and privacy constraints.
- **Evidence:** SPEC-11, SPEC-34, ADR-030, ADR-046 and `DEV-SPEECH-RELIABILITY-001` sections 5–7.
- **Decision:** Require an explicit external store, closed source index hashes and exact rights status; never implicitly download or ingest microphone turns.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Committing datasets, silent telemetry reuse, re-hosting Common Voice clips or accepting unknown terms as warnings.
- **Consequences:** The committed public-safe recipe remains planned until an operator acquires and verifies exact snapshots.
- **Uncertainty:** Final redistribution status of a trained artifact still needs source-by-source review.
- **Reconsider when:** Repository governance admits a source and derived artifact with exact provenance and notices.

### D-003 — R1 features fold history into bounded numbers, never into events

- **Observation:** The service already had a TURN_TOO_LARGE terminal failure from unbounded job serialization; appending revision history would reintroduce it.
- **Evidence:** Long-turn soak evidence in `audio-emotion-asr-timeline.md`; measured 30-s-like event at 12.6 KB with the new payload.
- **Decision:** Accumulate revisions incrementally with one retained previous-text buffer; emit only the numeric summary inside `utterance.final` metrics; any capture fault degrades to a typed incomplete payload without failing the turn.
- **Rejected alternatives:** Serializing `TranscriptRevisionTraceV0` rows into WebSocket events; client-side-only feature computation (would bypass the production path); failing sessions on feature bugs.
- **Consequences:** The client-side replay collector keeps the bounded trace externally only; wall-clock fields make the vector sequence-deterministic, not PCM-deterministic alone.
- **Reconsider when:** A consumer needs full revision traces at runtime rather than during offline corpus replay.

## Open hypotheses

| Hypothesis | Evidence for | Evidence against | Next discriminator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H1: transcript revision stability plus signal/VAD features can calibrate exact-match risk cheaply | Required signals now flow from the live path as a bounded vector with no second ASR | No frozen public replay/evaluation exists yet | Closed-corpus replay followed by source-disjoint R2 logistic baseline |
| H2: public-only calibration has useful target coverage | Common Voice/FLEURS cover Russian speakers and read/conversational domains | Whisper and real player microphone domain shift remain weakly represented | Held-out coverage/OOD report against the fixed gates |

## Required context

Read these sources in precedence order before acting:

1. `docs/architecture/agent-routing.md`; SPEC-11, SPEC-15, SPEC-16, SPEC-34; ADR-005, ADR-017, ADR-030, ADR-046 and ADR-053.
2. `docs/development/speech-recognition-reliability-public-data-spec-2026-08-20.md`.
3. `docs/development/task-state/audio-emotion-asr-timeline.md` for the resident service lineage and active Voxtral constraints.
4. `tools/speech-timeline/README.md` and `tools/speech-timeline/src/nextengine_speech_timeline/` for the implemented experiment boundary.

## Next action

1. Operator step: acquire Common Voice/FLEURS/MUSAN/RIRS snapshots outside Git, fill the recipe with verified hashes, run `reliability-corpus prepare`.
2. Bind the exact resident identity into a copy of the recipe (`identity_status: closed`) and run `reliability-corpus replay --asr-model <route> --mode paced` once per route.
3. Only with frozen replay outputs and proven splits, start R2 baselines (constant, stability rule, L2 logistic, optional isotonic) under the section-16 gates.

## Do not retry

- Player microphone recordings as an implicit training corpus — diagnostic retention is not training consent; reconsider only after a separate explicit opt-in program exists.
- Random filesystem-order splits — they leak derivatives/speakers and are not reproducible; retain fixed source/speaker hashing.
- Calling attenuated voiced speech “whisper” — it does not reproduce whisper acoustics; keep it labeled attenuation.
- Hidden retry loops around failed replay clips — one attempt per clip, failures stay typed rows.

## Handoff

- **Workspace state:** R1 feature capture, service-path integration and the prepared-corpus replay runner are committed as localized `tools/speech-timeline` changes; datasets, ready files, profiles and reports remain outside Git.
- **Checks:** 153 speech-timeline tests, compileall, CLI smoke (`score`, `dry-run`, `replay` refusal paths), `git diff --check` pass; `host-check` not run for this Python-only increment (no Rust/workspace surface touched).
- **Remaining risk:** No real corpus replayed or scored; determinism is proven for identical event sequences on fixtures, not across two live model runs whose wall timings differ by nature.
- **Promotion needed:** None; the feature payload stays an internal experiment schema until an Accepted ADR promotes a runtime contract.
